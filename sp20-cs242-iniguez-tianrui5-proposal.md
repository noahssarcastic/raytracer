# Overview

## Motivation
For this project I will be implementing a ray-tracer from scratch. Since coming 
to this school I have been ineterested in computer graphics. I took CS418 years 
ago but was never able to fit CS419 into my schedule. I bought the text book 
years ago to read in my own time but have never had the time to implement the 
theory. I see this project as the perfect time to finally pursue this passion 
project. Though I won't be able to implement all the features in the course or 
in the textbook, I hope to have the basic requirements of a ray-tracer and a 
few extra fun features at the end of this three weeks.

## Technology and Style
For this project I will be using C++ and be following the 
[Google C++ styleguide.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
I will also need to use an external open-source bitmap library since 
implementing the bitmap image format is out of the scope of this project. The 
code will be broken up into two main libraries and a command-line-interface. 
The two libraries will be a geometry library and an effects library. Both 
libraries will be implemented follwong OOP best practices.

## Features

### Geometries
* OBJ or PLY format support
* Ray-object intersection support for:
    * Planes
    * Spheres
    * Triangles
* Movable camera supporting:
    * Orthographic projection
    * Perspective projection

### Lighting
* Support for point lights
* Support for area lights

### Shading
* Support for shadows
* Support for diffuse and specular reflection (Phong model)

### Misc.
* Rendering a mirror-like object
* Rendering a transparent object
